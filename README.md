# 🔋 LSTM-Based Energy Forecasting

This project presents a **Deep Learning framework** using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** to forecast **residential community renewable energy generation and electricity demand**. It was developed as part of my **M.Tech thesis in ICT (Information and Communication Technology)**.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Accurate forecasting of electricity demand and renewable energy generation is critical for smart grid management, energy efficiency, and load balancing. Traditional statistical methods often fail to capture temporal patterns in complex energy datasets. This project explores **LSTM**, a powerful recurrent neural network, to address this challenge.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- 🔹 Python
- 🔹 NumPy, Pandas
- 🔹 Matplotlib, Seaborn
- 🔹 TensorFlow / Keras
- 🔹 LSTM (Sequential & Bidirectional)

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- ✅ Input Layer with Time-Series Data
- ✅ LSTM / Bi-LSTM Cells
- ✅ Dropout for Regularization
- ✅ Dense Output Layer with Linear Activation

## 📊 Results

Due to data unavailability in this public repo, exact performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) are not shared here. But in the thesis version, **Bidirectional LSTM performed best** in forecasting electricity demand over 24-hour cycles.
